Data set â€“ https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html

Sound can be an important cue for use in robotics or autonomous driving. An autonomous vehicle may want to pull to the side of the road if it hears a siren, for example.

We will analyze the UrbanSound8k dataset and build a model using some type of neural network. The goal will be to classify the 10 types of sounds present in the dataset for use in a robotics or autonomous driving application.
