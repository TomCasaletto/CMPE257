We are developing a component embedded in a self-driving app.

Our software is meant to take input of a street sign and determine if it is a Speed Limit sign.  Further, if it is a Speed Limit sign, we identify what the Speed Limit is.

* Data collection
 - we could individually go out and curate a set of images of US street signs
 - find a dataset online

* Implementation
 - build a neural net which inputs an image and output whether that image is a Speed Limit sign or not
 - if it is a Speed Limit sign, return the numerical value of the Speed Limit
