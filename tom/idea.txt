We are developing a component embedded in a self-driving app.  Assume another process segments visual images and passes our application a picture of a street sign.

Our software is meant to take input of an image of a street sign and determine if it is a Speed Limit sign or not.  Further, if it is a Speed Limit sign, we identify what the numerical value of the Speed Limit is.

* Data collection
 - we could individually go out and curate a set of images of US street signs and then clean up that set such that all images are labelled with Yes/No and a numbered value
 - all images need to be the same size
 - find a dataset online; possibly label if needed

* Implementation
 - build a neural net which inputs an image and output whether that image is a Speed Limit sign or not
 - if it is a Speed Limit sign, return the numerical value of the Speed Limit
