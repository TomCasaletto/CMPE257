Data set – https://www.kaggle.com/c/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/data
(As the data is synthetic it is highly usable, allowing us to focus on 
developing and training a machine learning model.)

Project idea
We will experiment with several mathematical noise reduction pre-processing 
approaches and construct a binary classification model on the pre-processed data
as entrants in the Gravitational Wave Detection Kaggle Competition.

We will study and experiment with several approaches to building a binary 
classification machine learning model, starting with the references below. 
We will use the Kaggle contest leaderboard to get ongoing feedback as to 
the viability of our models and approach.

Kaggle Competition:
"In this competition, you’ll aim to detect GW signals from the mergers of 
binary black holes. Specifically, you'll build a model to analyze simulated 
GW time-series data from a network of Earth-based detectors."


Submission Limits
We may submit a maximum of 5 entries per day to the leaderboard.
(Nice for timely feedback.)

We may select up to 2 final submissions for judging.

Class submission timeline:
We would submit our final entry by the final project report due date for our course of September 16, 2021.

Competition timeline: Ongoing now.
  September 22, 2021 - Entry deadline. 
  September 29, 2021 - Final submission deadline.
