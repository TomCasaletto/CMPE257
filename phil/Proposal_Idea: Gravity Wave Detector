Project title: Participate in the G2Net Gravitational Wave Detection Kaggle Competition.
"In this competition, you’ll aim to detect GW signals from the mergers of binary black holes. 
Specifically, you'll build a model to analyze simulated GW time-series data from a network of 
Earth-based detectors."

Competition timeline: Ongoing now.
  September 22, 2021 - Entry deadline. 
  September 29, 2021 - Final submission deadline.


Competition rules:
Team Limits
The maximum team size is 5.
(Our team has four members.)

Submission Limits
You may submit a maximum of 5 entries per day.
(Nice for timely feedback.)

You may select up to 2 final submissions for judging.

Class submission timeline:
We would submit our final entry by the final project 
    report due date for our course of September 16, 2021.

Data set – https://www.kaggle.com/c/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/data
(As the data is synthetic it is highly usable, allowing us to focus on 
developing and training a machine learning model.)

    "Your task will be to perform binary classification on this data and predict the probability 
    of a new time series being either noise or signal(along with noise)."
