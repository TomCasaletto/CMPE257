Data set – https://www.kaggle.com/c/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/data
(As the data is synthetic it is highly usable, allowing us to focus on 
developing and training a machine learning model.)

Project idea
We will experiment with several mathematical noise reduction pre-processing 
approaches and construct a binary classification model on the pre-processed data
as entrants in the Gravitational Wave Detection Kaggle Competition.

Steps to Complete the Project:
We will study and experiment with several approaches to removing noise from 
the supplied synthetic data and then building a binary classification machine 
learning model using that preprocessed data, starting with the references below.
(Especially reference 5.) We will use the Kaggle contest leaderboard to get 
ongoing feedback as to the viability of our models and approach.  And, we will use 
the contest discussion board to learn what approaches other contestants are following.

Kaggle Competition:
"In this competition, you’ll aim to detect GW signals from the mergers of 
binary black holes. Specifically, you'll build a model to analyze simulated 
GW time-series data from a network of Earth-based detectors."
and then research how to (and then) build a binary classification model to try to identify the signal. 
We may submit a maximum of 5 entries per day to the leaderboard. (Nice for timely feedback.)
Competition Final submission deadline: September 29, 2021.
